Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2129-5-30**] Pericardial Window and Pericardial Biopsy


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 112022**] is a 64 yo female with a recent admission for
posterior pericardial effusion ([**Date range (1) 49148**]) who presented with a
5 day history of left-sided chest pain.

Per recent cardiology clinic notes earlier this month, recent
right heart cath did not show tamponade.   She was discharged
from the hospital with the plan for monitoring with serial
echos. Unfortunately due to allergic reactions to ASA and
NSAIDs, anti-inflammatory agents could not be used, and she was
started on sole colchicine therapy. Steroid therapy was deferred
due to the concern for increased recurrence on lone colchicine.

She reported to the ED today with 5 days left-sided chest pain.
She reports chest pain is getting worse relative to her prior
admission on [**5-1**]. Her pain is pleuritic in nature with deep
inspiration and also has a sensation that she cannot take a full
breath. She reports mild nausea without emesis. Denies
fever/chills/diarrhea. Denies headache.  Per ED examination, the
patient appeared mildly uncomfortable and anxious with notable
tachycardia and tachypnea. Faint crackles in the lower lung
fields bilaterally.
Initial vitals were T99.8 HR 131 BP 106/57 RR16 98% and orally
reported pulsus of 10.  On EKG, she had sinus tachycardia at a
rate of 130, with low voltage, and no STE's.  Bedside ultrasound
at that time showed a pericardial effusion without evidence of
tamponade.  Labs showed a leukocytosis of 11.4 without bandemia,
and otherwise CMP showed a hemolyzed specimen without any other
electrolytes imbalances.  CXR showed poor inflation of the lungs
with enlarged heart borders consistent with her pericardial
efussion.  Left lower lobe opacity suggestive of efussion and
questionable hiatal hernia.
Transferred to the CCU for further monitoring and probable
pericardiocentesis in the AM. On transfer BP were 98/60 and
patient was tachycardic in the 110's.

In the ICU, patient is anxious about her procedure tomorrow
requesting what time she will have her pericardiocentesis and
who will be doing it.  She refuses to comply with history and
physical exam, saying she is anxious and wants to sleep.

=================================
TEE: [**2129-5-30**]
Pre-procedure:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
with normal free wall contractility.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion with a great deal
of echo dense material, most likely clot around the RA and RV.
The effusion itself measures from 1 to 2.5 cm in various
locations, but the supposed clot measures up to 3.5 cm across.

Post-Procedure:
There is a reduction in fluid anteriorly, but inferiorly and
laterally there is little change. Moreover, the gelatinous
material associated with the RV and RA is little changed.
=================================
TTE: [**2129-5-31**] Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2129-5-29**], the effusion appears similar to slightly smaller in
size and may be slightly more echo dense and organized.  The
effusion is echo dense, consistent with partial organization.
Cannot exclude mild right ventricular compression apically.The
pericardium may be thickened. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

=================================
BREAST ULTRASOUND:
FINDINGS: Limited son[**Name (NI) 493**] images were obtained of the left
breast in the region of the patient's pain, which demonstrate no
drainable fluid collection or mass.

IMPRESSION:  Limited study demonstrates no fluid collection to
suggest
abscess.  If there is continued clinical concern for a palpable
abnormality, followup with mammography and/or ultrasound is
recommended in a dedicated breast imaging clinic.
=================================

Brief Hospital Course:
64 year-old female with PMH of diabetes mellitus,
hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism presenting with chest pain
and enlargement of pericardial effusion.

Active diagnoses:
#Pericardial Effusion: Pt presented with pericardial effusion
larger than past admission [**2129-5-1**].  Pericardiocentesis
unsuccessful due to significant cell debris so pt taken for
pericardial window [**5-30**] with pericardial biopsy and removal of
1500cc of gelatinous fluid from the pericardial space.  Pt
tolerated procedure well and remained hemodynamically stable in
the CVICU.  Pt extubated on POD1, chest tube removed POD2 and
transferred to the floor.

No tamponade physiology during current or past admission.
Etiology of effusion was unclear.  Differential included
post-viral, infectious (including TB in setting of recent travel
to [**Country 3400**] [**12/2128**], as well as parasitic infections), autoimmune,
malignancy, hypothyroidism.  Pericardial and pleural fluid
cytology negative.  Allergy consult was obtained did not feel
that her history of urticaria would be contributing to such a
presentation.  Rheumatology consulted but no obvious systemic
rheumatologic condition.  Screening labs including [**Doctor First Name **], RF,
anti-ds-DNA, TSH, complement levels WNL.  Pathology of
pericardium and gelatinous pericardial fluid rather nonspecific
showing fibrinous exudate, fibrosis, and acute and chronic
inflammation.
Pt was sent to the CCU for aspirin desensitization. She
tolerated it well without any complications. She was sent home
on ibuprofen 800mg TID and asa 81 mg daily.

# L breast tenderness and redness: Pt developed L breast
tenderness and redness at the inferior aspect of the left breast
around the inframammary incision.  The surgical team evaluated
the pt and believed the symptoms were likely due to manipulation
during surgery.  The redness improved.

# Sinus tachycardia: Pt runs in 100s per records, which
continued during hospital course.

Chronic diagnoses:
#HLD: continue Crestor
#DM: ISS transitioned to PO metformin.  Pt stable on regimen.
#Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine 150mcg. TSH WNL.

Transitional issues:
-continue workup for pericardiac effusion
-patient has been desensitized to NSAIDS including aspirin
-patient has follow up with allergy, rheumatology and cardiology
with cardiac MR scheduled prior to cards follow up.
-if mass in left breast does not resolve will need proper
diagnostic mamography.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 112022**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 **].
You came into the hospital because of chest pain due to the
fluid around your heart (called a pericardial effusion). You had
to have surgery to remove some of this fluid.  The cause of this
fluid is still not clear, but tests have been sent off to try to
find the cause.  Your heart doctor will follow-up on these
results and share them with you.  You were seen by our
allergists and our rheumatologists to help diagnose this
mystery.  It was felt that you would benefit from several weeks
of ibuprofen treatment and given your history of allergy were
sent to the intensive care unit for a desensitization procedure.


Please have your blood work checked in 1 week, a prescription
has been provided for you.

Several medications have been changed please refer to your
medication list for the details of your medications.

Please make sure to keep your follow up appointments listed
below.  Also you will need to have a follow up MRI of your
heart, please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9559**] 2 weeks prior to your
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 112025**] on [**2129-6-22**] to ensure it has been
scheduled.

Please shower daily including washing incisions gently with mild
soap, no baths or swimming. Look at your incisions daily. Please
NO lotions, cream, powder, or ointments to incisions.
Urticaria is a skin irritation characterized by reddened and slightly swollen lesions, such as welts, that appear on the skin and are very itchy.
It is usually characterized by red patches and papules that cause itching tingling.
